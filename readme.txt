# Code can only run out of the box with openai and gratitude. 
# Llama requires some modification for a high performance computing environment
# NCB and MM require data that are not publically available. 



* In library folder, create secrets.py file containing just one line, containing your OpenAI key:
OPENAI_API_KEY = "YOURKEYHERE"
Do not commit this file. (Already included in .gitignore.)

* Update start.py with location of files.
